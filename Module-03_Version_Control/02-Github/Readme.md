# GitHub

## What is GitHub?

- You can use GitHub and Git to collaborate on work.
- GitHub is a cloud-based vcs platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.
- GitHub is built on top of git.
- It intelligently tracks changes in files present in git repo.
- Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:
  1. Showcase or share your work.
  2. Track and manage changes to your code over time.
  3. Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
  4. Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.

## Where do I start?

### Step-01: Create a personal GitHub account to get started with GitHub

- Navigate to https://github.com/
- Click Sign up
- Follow the prompts to create your personal account
- During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address.
- Note: Without a verified email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.

### Step-02: Learn GitHub flow and the GitHub key concepts (branches, commits, pull-requests etc)

- Create and use a repository
- Create and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open a pull request
- Address review comments
- Merge a pull request
- Delete your branch (if required)

### Step-03: Connecting to GitHub

Working directly on GitHub.com is often the quickest way to contribute to a repository. However, you may use any IDE (VS Code) on your local system to work on more complex changes and once done you may push it to your GitHub repos.

### Step-04: Explore GitHub to find inspiration for your own projects and connect with others

### Step-05: Learn how to download interesting code for your own use

### Step-06: Learn how to upload something you're working on to a GitHub repository.
